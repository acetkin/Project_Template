# Project Template

This repository is a system template for running projects using a strict, documentation-driven workflow with LLM assistance.

This is NOT a project repository.
No project-specific content lives here.

## Purpose
This template provides a complete operating system for starting and running projects with:
- Explicit human approval
- Deterministic documentation structure
- Controlled LLM behavior
- Clear separation between rules, state, and content

## What This Repository Contains
- A complete documentation structure under /_docs
- System-level rules and directives for LLM operation
- Empty but structured skeleton files for project execution

## What This Repository Does NOT Contain
- No project ideas
- No project requirements
- No implementation code
- No business or domain-specific content

## How It Is Used
1. Create a new repository using this template.
2. Open the repository in VS Code.
3. Provide an initial project prompt to the LLM.
4. The LLM follows the rules defined in /_docs to propose and document the project.
5. All documentation changes require explicit human approval.

## Core Principles
- SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md is the single source of truth.
- Documentation changes follow a strict proposal lifecycle.
- Context, decisions, stages, and tasks are strictly separated.
- LLMs may assist but never act autonomously.

## Status
SYSTEM v1.0 – Stable
