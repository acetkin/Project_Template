# Handoff Protocol
This document defines how the project context is handed off between humans, LLMs, or work sessions.
It ensures continuity without reinterpretation or redecision.

## Handoff Trigger
- A handoff occurs when work pauses, ownership changes, or a new session begins.
- A handoff may be planned or unplanned.
- Every handoff must reference the current Context_Packet.md.

## Handoff Checklist
- Context_Packet.md is up to date.
- All approved decisions are logged in Decision_and_Change_Log.md.
- Active development stage is identified.
- Task_Board.md reflects current task status.

## Handoff Summary
- Current objective at the time of handoff.
- Active constraints and assumptions.
- Open questions blocking progress.
- Immediate next focus.

## Incoming Instructions
- What the next operator or LLM should do first.
- What must not be changed without approval.
- What areas are explicitly out of scope.

## Verification
- The handoff is considered valid only if all checklist items are satisfied.
- Incomplete handoffs must be flagged before any action is taken.
