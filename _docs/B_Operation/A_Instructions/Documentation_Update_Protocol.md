# Documentation Update Protocol
This document defines how documentation changes are proposed, approved, and applied.

## Core Principle
No documentation change is allowed without explicit human approval.

## Update Lifecycle
All documentation updates follow this lifecycle.

### 1. Propose
- The LLM prepares a Doc Update Proposal.
- No file is modified.
- The proposal must follow the required format.

### 2. Freeze
- The LLM halts all related actions.
- No assumptions or follow-up actions are allowed.
- The LLM waits for explicit approval.

### 3. Apply
- Only after approval, the LLM applies the change in VS Code.
- Only the approved change may be applied.
- No additional edits are allowed.

## Proposal Format (Mandatory)
Every proposal MUST include:
- File
- Section
- Old text
- Proposed text
- Rationale
- Requires approval: YES
Incomplete proposals must be rejected.
